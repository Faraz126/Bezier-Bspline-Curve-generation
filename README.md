# Bezier and Bspline Curve/Surface generation

The code was written as part of different assignment(s) for the course geometric modelling and numerical analysis

For any mesh or data points, the code produces bezier/bspline curve if the data points are 2D, else it produces a surface. 
The curve and surface is plotted using matplotlib. 

The main.py file contains sample code explaining how to produce curves of different types
